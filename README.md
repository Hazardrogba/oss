# Header 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a
simple formating syntax for authoring web pages,

Use an asterisk mark to provide emphasis, such
as  *Italic* or **bold**

Create lists with a dash:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

```
Use back ticks to
create a block of code
```

Embed LaTex or MathML equations,
$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$

Or even footnotes, citations, and a
bibliography. [^1]
